## Installation

Inside the folder of your new Hugo site run:

```sh
    $ mkdir themes
    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/chen-zhe/photo-grid
```
For more information read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.


## Getting started

After installing the theme successfully it requires a just a few more steps to get your site running.


### The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/Chen-Zhe/photo-grid/blob/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](https://github.com/Chen-Zhe/photo-grid/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml). To use it, copy the `config.toml` in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change the strings in this theme.

EXIF info display can be disabled by setting `no_exif = true` in the config

### Photo Management

All photos are stored in the [`photo`](https://github.com/Chen-Zhe/photo-grid/blob/master/exampleSite/content/photo) folder under the `content` folder. You can put multiple directories under it and the theme will enumerate all photos within in order of the directory listing. Within each subfolder, e.g. [`1-trip1`](https://github.com/Chen-Zhe/photo-grid/blob/master/exampleSite/content/photo/1-trip1), you can put all relevant photos in it and then copy over the `index.md` file.

Within [`index.md`](https://github.com/Chen-Zhe/photo-grid/blob/master/exampleSite/content/photo/1-trip1/index.md) file, you can specify each photo's name, description and other properties. Take a look at the descriptions to understand what can be customized.

### Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server. 

    $ hugo server

Now enter `localhost:1313` in the address bar of your browser.
